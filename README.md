# Tutorial-Reactivities

This project is based entirely on the tutorial by Neil Cummings (Udemy - Complete guide to building an app with ASP .Net Core, React, and Mobx). It revolves around activities where users can join, view, or create an activity. Additionally, users can chat with others about the activity. The project is almost complete, with just a few minor aspects remaining to be addressed, primarily related to hosting.
