# -Tutorial-Reactivities-

This project it's based completely on the tutorial of Neil Cummings (Udemy - Complete guide to building an app with ASP .Net Core, React, and Mobx).
It's a project that you can use about activities where you can join, view, or create an activity. You can also chat with other people
about the activity. It's completed just misses a couple of small things about hosting.
